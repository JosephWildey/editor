# editor

This is a simple editor I wrote in Python with Tkinter. It's pretty barebones in terms of functionality, but aside from most of the typical stuff word editors have it includes the following:

- Word count
- Word frequency

It uses regex to pull words out of the content. It might still overcount, I have not tested it thoroughly. However, it will now count hyphenated words as one word.

# Future features

- Save/Open functionality
- Scrollable word frequency window instead of a simple popup

There was more but I forgot. School and classes have been stressful. Sorry, slacking. Trying to get back into this.

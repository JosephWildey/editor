# editor

This is a simple editor I wrote in Python with Tkinter. It's pretty barebones in terms of functionality, but aside from most of the typical stuff word editors have it includes the following:

- Word count
- Word frequency

It uses regex to pull words out of the content. It seems to sometimes overcount based on blackboard's wordcount. I should probably include a hyphen in the regex to make sure it counts hyphenated words as one, not two. 

# Future features

I still need to implement save/open functionality. I've been slacking because of my classes, but I should have more time as my first six weeek class is almost over. The second class should be a cakewalk. I'll add comments and clean up code during that time.

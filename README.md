# editor

This is a simple editor I wrote in Python with Tkinter. It's pretty barebones in terms of functionality, but aside from most of the typical stuff word editors have it includes the following:

- Word count
- Word frequency

It uses regex to pull words out of the content. It might still overcount, I have not tested it thoroughly. However, it will now count hyphenated words as one word.

# Future features

I still need to implement save/open functionality. I've been slacking because of my classes and school in general.

I want to clean up the window that shows word frequency by making it scrollable. That will probably come in the following weeks as I clean up my code and stuff.

# editor

This is a simple editor I wrote in Python with Tkinter. It's pretty barebones in terms of functionality, but aside from most of the typical stuff word editors have it includes the following:

- Word count
- Word frequency

It uses regex to pull words out of the content. It might still overcount, I have not tested it thoroughly. It also breaks formatting at the moment when a file is opened. However, it will now count hyphenated words as one word. I have plans to expand this project, but school has a way of getting in the way and being super stressful.

# Future plans
I've got a kanban board set up to keep myself on track, but I'll share some of my ideas. 

- Improve the GUI (make the popup scrollable)
- Improve the architecture (improve efficiency)
- Implement typical office tools into the word editor directly (e.g. launch independent calculator from menubar w/ option to insert equations or results into textbox)
- cloud synchronization (made for school projects after all)
- improve analysis output (make it prettier, easier to read, etc)
